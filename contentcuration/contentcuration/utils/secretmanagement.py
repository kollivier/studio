    Return the secret value stored in the secret key called secret_name.

    The following secret storage locations are supported:
    - environment variables
    - Google Cloud Storage, encrypted with KMS

    If secret_storage is None (the default), then it will read the SECRET_STORAGE
    environment variable. If it's not defined, or the value is "ENV_VARS", then continue
    reading the secret from the environment variables, returning an empty string if
    that secret is not found.

    If the SECRET_STORAGE env var is defined and is set to "KMS_GCS", then it will download
    small files from GCS, decrypt them using GCloud KMS keys. You will need to make sure that
    the VM or environment has permission to access GCS and the KMS keys. You can do that by either
    running `gcloud auth login` on your local dev machine, or setting the right service account
    on your GCE VM.

    If you're using the KMS_GCS option, you will need to define the following additional environment variables.

    SECRET_STORAGE_GCP_PROJECT_ID: the env var to point to your GCP project ID where the secrets are stored.

    SECRET_STORAGE_ENVIRONMENT: Either one of dev, staging or prod. There are secrets specific to each environment
    that help isolate data to each environment. See the deploy/secretmanage executable found at the root of
    this repo. If not defined, this defaults to "dev".

    In addition, you can define an optional SECRET_STORAGE_GCP_KMS_LOCATION to point to the datacenter
     where your KMS keys live. If not defined, this defaults to 'global'. See GCloud KMS docs for more detail.
